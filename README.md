# Idea Nursery

The inspiration for *Idea Nusery* came from the realization that, for me at least, the typical thought that occurs to me is a very long way from deserving to be called an *idea*. It is more like a seed that might, with sufficient love and care, sprout, become a seedling and eventually become a plant worthy of a place in the garden. What's needed, I thought, is a place to plant such thoughts where they will not be forgotten and where they can be given the attention they need to develop - in short, a nursery for ideas.


## Ideas 

In this digital nursery ideas have these properties:

- name   
A brief, suggestive label

- description  
Depends on the stage of developement - utimately a useful description of the idea with tags and links.

- stage of development
    - thought 
    - kernel 
    - strategy 
    - idea 
    - keeper

- status
    - storage - paused for the moment 
    - nursery - where the action occurs 
    - library - the garden for keepers

The stages of development parallel the seed-to-plant metaphor: 

- thought   
Following the addage "You never know what you're thinking until you write it down", the first stage involves naming and describing the thought well enough to remember at a glance what you were thinking. At this stage, the idea will be little more than a suggestive **name** and no more than a brief **description**.

- kernel  
The core or essence of the thought. Often this is a question. An example from this project would be "What ARE the stages of developement of a thought?" This stage persists until **description** contains a precise statement of *exactly* what would be needed to make this thought a *keeper* - *worth remembering and sharing*. If a question, what would be the requirements for an answer to be a *keeper*?  Not every thought survives this stage. My father used to remind me to "boil it down". Sometimes nothing is left. ðŸ˜Š 

- strategy  
An exporation of possibilities for getting to being a *keeper*. Often this involves asking yourself *what if* questions and lasts until a promising strategy is identified. In the pre-digital era, a pencil with a large eraser was essential at this stage.

- keeper  
This stage persists until *worth remembering and sharing* is attained and well expressed in the combination of **name** and **description**. Back and forths to **strategy** may be necessary. Additionally, **description** should contain useful `#tags` and `[links]` to make the idea easy to find and to expose its connections to other ideas. When this is done, the idea is ready to be moved to **library**.
